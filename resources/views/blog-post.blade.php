                    Recently, we had the opportunity to get feedback from several students and one of my teachers
                    about this website. I also had to create a poster to show off my motivation and the view of this
                    site.

                            <li>Make Baby Yoda scroll down: I've tried it but can't seem to figure it out, wich is
                                no big problem as we both agreed that it would not really add extra value to the
                                site.</li>
                            <li>Ongoing status colour change: It first was more grey and so not really a good
                                highlight colour so I agree that it had to been changed.</li>
                            <li>Make the site less empty: I dissagreed with this one as my site it meant to be
                                minimalistic and simple.</li>
                            <li>Keep the navigation inside a blog-post: I agreed. People still want to be able to
                                navigate through my site via a post.</li>

                            <li>More comments inside of HTML files: I do agree although most of my files are pretty
                                clearly readable.</li>
